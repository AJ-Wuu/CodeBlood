Nodes & Height -> N <= 2^H - 1

Red-Black Tree: BST that stay balanced.

Shortest BST (Red-Black Tree):
    size <= 2^height - 1
    height = log(size) - 1
Longest BST:
    height <= 2*log(size/2) - 1

rotate search, insert, delete: O(logn)

Properties:
    1. every node is either red or black (every new node is red)
    2. root node is black <- check this at the end of each insertion
    3. null children are black -- every leaf (NIL) is black
    4. red nodes can only have 0 or 2 black node children, and no red child (if a node is red, then both its children are black)
           a red node cannot only have one child (if the only child is red, violate the color rule; if the only child is black, violate the black-height rule)
           a black node can only have one red child (and it's a red leaf), but cannot only have one black child
    5. for each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes (black height)
    
Balance for Red-Black Trees is defined through black node heights, which completely ignore the distribution of red nodes throughout the tree.
    This is OK to do because that distribution is limited by the red-black tree property/rule: no red node with red child.
    
Cascading Fix: multiple layers

Double Black: when a black node is deleted and replaced by a black child, the child is marked as double black.

Different cases of insertion is determined by: 1. the color of the uncle; 2. the node is the left / right child of its parent

Standard BST insert algorithm sufficient for inserting a new red node into a red-black tree (ie. there is no need to resolve any red-black tree property violations):
    When the sibling's position is non-null
