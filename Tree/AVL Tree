Balance factor for a node: ________________ - ________________
When the absolute value of this is > ________, then rotations are applied to correct this.
The nodes within any AVL tree ________________ to form a valid red-black tree.
But the nodes within a red-black may have a balance factor that is ________________.
This tradeoff can be understood as AVL trees spending more time __________________
        versus red-black trees spending more time _________________.
