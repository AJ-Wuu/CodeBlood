1. To be able to connect with an SSH client to our GCP VM, we need to set a password for our user on the VM. With username replaced with the name of your user, type:
        sudo passwd username
   You will then be asked to type in your new password twice. You will not see any characters while typing.
2. Open the config file for the SSH server in an editor (in the example we will use Vim) with the sudo command so that you will have the rights to edit it:
        sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
3. In the file, find the line that starts with "PasswordAuthentication", and change its value from "no" to "yes".
4. Restart the SSH server with the updated configuration:
        sudo systemctl restart sshd
5. We can now connect to our VM with (replace username with your username and IP-address with the IP address of your VM):
        ssh username@IP-address
6. After typing our password, we are logged into the GCP VM and can run commands on the shell.
7. To exit the VM again, type:
        exit
8. We can use ssh to copy files between the VM and another machine with the scp command. 
   To copy the file Main.java in our home directory on the VM to the current folder, 
   we can use (replace username with your username and IP-address with the IP address of your VM):
        scp username@IP-address:~/Main.java ./
9. To copy fileToCopy into the home directory on the VM, we can use (replace username with your username and IP-address with the IP address of your VM):
        scp fileToCopy username@IP-address:~/
10. All lab computers in the CS department run an SSH server, and we can connect to them remotely. 
    To connect to the best available department machine (replace csl-username with you CSL username):
        ssh csl-username@best-linux.cs.wisc.edu
