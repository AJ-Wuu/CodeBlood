# Three Dimensions of Testing:
Unit VS Integration: Unit -> for a specific module / method /task, tested in isolation; Integration -> test components working together, better for larger spectrum
Black-box VS White-box: Black -> without knowing / access to any internal piece of code; White -> knowing details and test internals
Output VS Property: Output -> input / output of the data structure; Property -> general property of the implementation, independent to the value being used
