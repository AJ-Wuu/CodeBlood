1. In our cloned repository we have one branch (main) so far:
        cd newProjectClone
        git branch
2. We can create a new branch, for example to develop the frontend of our application, with:
        git checkout -b frontend
   Notice that
        git checkout -b <newbranch>
      will create a new branch named newbranch if it does not exist, or reset it if it exists.
3. We are now on the new branch we just created:
        git branch
4. Now we start working on the frontend:
        vim Frontend.java
        vim README.txt
5. Then we create a new version on the frontend branch:
        git add Frontend.java
        git add README.txt
        git commit -m “Added new Frontend class and README.txt.”
        git log
6. When we switch back to the main branch, it is still in the old state:
        git checkout main
        git log
7. And the repo we cloned from does not know about the new branch yet:
        cd ../newProject
        git branch
        git log
        cd ../newProjectClone
8. We can publish the new branch to the remote repo with:
        git push --set-upstream origin frontend
9. And we now have the frontend branch and its version in the remote repo:
        cd ../newProject
        git branch
10. And can switch to it there:
        git checkout frontend
        git log
