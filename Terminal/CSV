Stands for "Comma-Separated Values."
CSV is a standard way to store structured data in a plain text format.

Since CSV files use the comma character "," to separate columns, values that contain commas must be handled as a special case.
These fields are wrapped within double quotation marks.
    The first double quote signifies the beginning of the column data, and the last double quote marks the end.
    If the value contains a string with double quotes, these are replaced by two double quotes, or "".

Some standard CSV formatting rules:
1. Table data is represented using only plain text.
2. The first line may or may not represent the table header.
3. Rows are separted by line breaks (newline characters).
4. Columns (fields) are separated by commas.
5. All lines contain the same number of values.
6. Fields that contain commas must begin and end with double quotes.
7. Fields that contain line breaks must begin and end with double quotes (not all programs support values with line breaks).
8. All other fields do not require double quotes.
9. Double quotes within values are represented by two contiguous double quotes.
