1. To merge the frontend branch into the main branch in our cloned repo, we switch to the branch that we want to merge into:
        git checkout main
        git branch
        git log
2. And then merge the frontend branch into it:
        git merge frontend
3. The main branch now has all version of the frontend branch:
        git log
4. Often there will be conflicts when merging. To demonstrate, we will edit README.txt in both branches:
        vim README.txt
        git commit -a -m “Added new line to README.txt for main.”
        git checkout frontend
        vim README.txt
        git commit -a -m “Added new line to README.txt for frontend.”
5. Now when we merge frontend into main, we will get a merge conflict:
        git checkout main
        git merge frontend
6. We need to manually resolve with an editor:
        vim README.txt
7. And then commit the new (resolved) version of our code:
        git commit -a -m “Resolved conflict in README.txt by manually merging line.”
8. The resolved version is now in our branch main:
        git log
