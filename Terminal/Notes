3 dimension of testing:
Unit VS Integration: Unit -> for a specific module / method /task, tested in isolation; Integration -> test components working together, better for larger spectrum
Black-box VS White-box: Black -> without knowing / access to any internal piece of code; White -> knowing details and test internals
Output VS Property: Output -> input / output of the data structure; Property -> general property of the implementation, independent to the value being used

Version Control Systems (eg. git):
1. provide easy way to backup and restore of different versions that we're working on
2. track changes through different versions of our code
3. manage multiple users with concurrent changes on the code base
