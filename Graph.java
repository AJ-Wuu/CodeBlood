/**
 * Shallow Copy: If the field value is a reference to an object (e.g., a memory address) it copies the reference.
 *               The referenced objects are thus shared, so if one of these objects is modified (from A or B), the change is visible in the other.
 *               Shallow copies are simple and typically cheap, as they can be usually implemented by simply copying the bits exactly.
 * Deep Copy: Fields are dereferenced.
 *            Rather than references to objects being copied, new copy objects are created for any referenced objects, and references to these placed in B.
 *            The objects referenced by the copy B are distinct from those referenced by A, and independent.
 *            Deep copies are more expensive, due to needing to create additional objects, 
 *                and can be substantially more complicated, due to references possibly forming a complicated graph.
