# Three Dimensions of Testing:
1. Unit VS Integration:  
* Unit -> for a specific module / method /task, tested in isolation
* Integration -> test components working together, better for larger spectrum  
2. Black-box VS White-box:  
* Black -> without knowing / access to any internal piece of code
* White -> knowing details and test internals  
3. Output VS Property:  
* Output -> input / output of the data structure
* Property -> general property of the implementation, independent to the value being used
