# Java SE 11
## How Java Works
* Source code -> plain text -> .java
* Compile into byte code -> .class **for JVM**
* Java Virtual Machine must be installed on a target computer
## Class & Object
* Java code is structured with CLASS, which represents a concept and defines attributes it can store & operations and algorithms it is capable of
* Object is a specific instance of a class, which can have specific values for each attribute, invoke operations at run time, and be referenced using a variable of a relevant type
