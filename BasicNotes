util VS awt
  java.util.* contains some tool classes, such as List, Map, HashMap, Set, etc.
  java.awt.* encapsulates the classes related to graphics drawing, such as Point, Line, etc.

    **MVC stands for Model–View–Controller, 
          which is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
          
Interface & Abstract Classes************************************************************************************************************************************************
A class can extend only one superclass and can implement any number of interfaces simultaneously.
extends: A derived class can extend a base class. You may redefine the behaviour of an established relation. Derived class "is a" base class type.
         	It is not compulsory that subclass that extends a superclass override all the methods in a superclass.
          Any number of interfaces can be extended by interface.
implements: You are implementing a contract. The class implementing the interface "has a" capability.
            In an interface you can not implement any of the declared methods. Only the class that "implements" the interface can implement the methods.
            It is compulsory that class implementing an interface has to implement all the methods of that interface.
            An @Override tag is not required for implementing an interface, as there is nothing in the original interface methods to be overridden.
            An interface can never implement any other interface.

static**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
1. The keyword static indicates that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type.
2. Static Field
   2.1. If a field is declared static, then exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class
   2.2. From the memory perspective, static variables go in a particular pool in JVM memory called Metaspace 
        (before Java 8, this pool was called Permanent Generation or PermGen, which was completely removed and replaced with Metaspace)
   2.3. Compelling Reasons to Use static Fields: 
        2.3.1. When the value of variable is independent of objects
        2.3.2. When the value is supposed to be shared across all objects
   2.4. Key Points to Remember:
        2.4.1. since static variables belong to a class, they can be accessed directly using class name and don't need any object reference
        2.4.2. static variables can only be declared at the class level
        2.4.3. static fields can be accessed without object initialization
        2.4.4. although we can access static fields using an object reference (like ford.numberOfCars++), 
               we should refrain from using it as in this case it becomes difficult to figure whether it’s an instance variable or a class variable; 
               instead, we should always refer to static variables using class name (for example, in this case, Car.numberOfCars++)
