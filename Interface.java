/**
 * "Programming for interfaces than implementation"
 * Interfaces allow us to:
 *     1. implement polymorphic behaviour (of course, abstract classes can also be used to implement polymorphic behaviour)
 *     2. develop very loosely coupled systems
 *     3. mock for better unit testing
 *     4. implement multiple class inheritance
 *     5. implement Inverson of Control or Dependancy Injection
 *     6. enable parallel application development
 *     7. avoid a massive hierarchical type framework
