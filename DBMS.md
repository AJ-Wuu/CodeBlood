# DBMS = Database Management System
## Models
### RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)
* Good for structured data
* Providers: MySQL, PostgreSQL, REDIS
  * use SQL and store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships
### NoSQL
* Good for unstructured or semi-structured data
  * e.g., documents, key-value pairs, graphs, time-series data
* Providers: MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Cassandra
  * usually have their own special query languages or APIs tailored to their data models and capabilities

| Speciality | mature, widely adopted, open-source, good general-purpose performance | open-source, highly extensible, strong SQL compliance, focus on data integrity and complex data types | extremely fast, supports various data structures (strings, lists, sets, hashes, etc.), can be used as a database, cache, and message broker | cloud-native, designed for resilience, horizontal scalability, and strong consistency (**PostgreSQL wire-compatible**) | serverless, self-contained, transactional, file-based | fully managed SaaS, separates compute and storage, designed for elasticity and concurrency | stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON), document-oriented |
| Schema | predefined | predefined | predefined | predefined | predefined | schema-on-read | flexible |
| Threading | single | multi | single | multi | single | multi | multi |
| Scalability (scale out = horizontal = sharding) | scale up, or out with effort | scale up, or out with effort | clusterable | scale out | embedded, single file on disk | both | scale out |
| Implementation Language | C, C++ | C | C with specialized value types (like strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets) | Go | JavaScript (uses [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to convert SQLite's C code into JavaScript) | C++ | Python |

## Terminology
* `VARCHAR(50) & CHAR(50)` -> if the text has only 5 characters, then actual `VARCHAR()` = 5, but `CHAR()` will still be 50 (with auto-filled spaces)
* PK - Primary Key
* NN - Not Null
* BIN - BINary (stores data as binary strings; no character is set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values)
* UN - UNsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)
* UQ - UniQue key (create or remove)
* ZF - Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th digit. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc.)
* AI - Auto Increment
* G - Generated column, i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns
* Foreign Key
  * a column or set of columns that allow us to establish a referential link between the data in two tables
  * helps to match the foreign key column data with the data of the referenced table data
  * the referenced table is called the parent table and the table that involves a foreign key is called the child table
  * if a foreign key references another column of the same table, this reference type is called a self-reference

| Inner Join                                                                      | Outer Join |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Only matching common records or values from both the database tables            | All the records from the database tables are taken (no require for common ID) |
| All rows will have real value                                                   | Some entries may return a null value |
| No alternatives or variants                                                     | Outer join can be left, right, or full join |
| Optimizer can be used as it gives many valuable options                         | Optimizer use limited as the joins take all the entries (not practical) |
| Have the least entries and will be able to update the user requirements         | Usage must be monitored and checked thoroughly |
| Slower                                                                          | (Especially left outer joins) faster and better performance in most cases |
| Conditions are mandatory to be satisfied                                        | No conditions that we have to meet necessarily |
| No output of those entries having no matching with the entries of another table | Get null if entries of one table do not have any matching with another table |
| Straightforward process (matching not be considered for left or right tables)   | Check either condition is given for left or right tables and entry is considered accordingly except full outer join |
| Recommended if a related data entry is needed as per the customer requirement or database design | More suitable for the others |
