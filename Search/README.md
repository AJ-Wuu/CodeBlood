# BFS & DFS
| Comparison | Notion       | Data Structure | Backtracking | Edges on the Path | Speed  | Memory      | Optimality  |
|-----------:|:------------:|---------------:|-------------:|------------------:|-------:|------------:|------------:|
| BFS        | Vertex-based | Queue          | No           | Less (shortest)   | Slower | Inefficient | Optimal for finding the shortest distance, not in cost |
| DFS        | Edge-based   | Stack          | Yes          | More              | Faster | Efficient   | NA |

# Single Number
A XOR A = 0, so when we know every element appears twice except for one, we could XOR them all to find out the unique one.
